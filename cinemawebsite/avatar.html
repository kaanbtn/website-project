                <p>Animated films following Avatar Kyoshi or Zuko’s journey to find his mother have both been popular picks among fans for years, thanks in large part to the books and comics detailing these events. When news of an animated Avatar film first dropped, many fans assumed it would dig into one of these established storylines.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Instead, the animated film is focused around something else: Team Avatar in their young adulthoods. Fans have already seen Aang and the Gaang in their adolescence, as they fought against Firelord Ozai and his army, and in their later years in Legend of Korra. The sequel Avatar series includes several members of the original team, including Katara and Toph, but many favorites were absent from the show. Stories and flashbacks filled in some of the gaps about these beloved characters’ lives, but fans were left with bare details about what transpired in the decades between Aang’s story and Korra’s.</p>
